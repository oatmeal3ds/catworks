how to put it on a game:

3. add it to your game and done

how to use it:
1. to open the ad window, broadcast "show ad"
2. to end the ad, set "end ad" to 1

bonus: theres a list in this repository that has all ad links so you can just make a pull request having the link to the website of your ad! (sorry but showing html is broken for the iframe extension so you have to make a website for it)
